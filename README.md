 
# Gold Price Prediction (Machine Learning Project)

## 🎯 Project Overview  
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict the **price of gold** based on historical data and relevant features. The primary goal is to explore time series forecasting, feature engineering, and model evaluation in the financial domain.

## 🚀 Features & Highlights  
- Data preprocessing (cleaning, scaling, feature engineering)  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization  
- Time series modeling (e.g. ARIMA, LSTM, or regression-based approaches)  
- Model training, validation, and performance metrics  
- Prediction interface (in Jupyter Notebook)  
- Insights and interpretation of results
