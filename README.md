Gold Price Predictor (Jupyter Notebook)
Overview
This project is a Gold Price Prediction application implemented as a Jupyter Notebook. It uses historical gold price data and machine learning/time series models (e.g., Linear Regression, ARIMA, LSTM, etc.) to forecast future gold prices. This notebook serves as an end-to-end demonstration, from data acquisition and cleaning to model training, evaluation, and future price visualization.
Features
 * Data Acquisition and Preprocessing: Includes steps for loading historical gold price data (e.g., from a CSV file or API) and performing necessary cleaning, feature engineering, and normalization.
 * Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and statistical analysis to understand the gold price trends, seasonality, and correlations with other financial indicators (if included).
 * Multiple Modeling Approaches: Demonstrates the implementation of one or more predictive models for time series forecasting (e.g., LSTM for deep learning, ARIMA for statistical modeling, or Linear~Regression as a baseline).
 * Model Evaluation: Uses standard time series metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE, R^2) to evaluate the performance of the trained models.
 * Price Forecasting: Generates and visualizes future gold price predictions.
 * Interactive Visualizations: (If applicable) Utilizes libraries like Plotly or Bokeh for dynamic charting.
Prerequisites
Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following installed:
 * Python (3.7+)
 * Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
Installation and Setup
 * Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/gold-price-predictor.git
cd gold-price-predictor

 * Create and activate a virtual environment (Recommended):
   python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
# .\venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows

 * Install the required libraries:
   The dependencies are typically listed in a requirements.txt file.
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   (If you don't have a requirements.txt, you will need to list and install the libraries used, such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, tensorflow/pytorch, etc.)
Usage
 * Launch Jupyter Notebook/Lab:
   jupyter notebook
# OR
jupyter lab

 * Open the Notebook:
   Navigate to and open the main notebook file (e.g., Gold_Price_Prediction.ipynb).
 * Run the Cells:
   Execute the notebook cells sequentially. The comments and Markdown cells within the notebook will guide you through the data processing, model training, and prediction steps.
 * Data Source:
   * The notebook is designed to use data from: data/gold_price_historical.csv (Replace this with the actual file path or data source name).
   * If the notebook uses an API for real-time data, ensure you have the necessary API key configured (this should be noted in a configuration file or the notebook itself, avoiding hardcoding in the notebook).
